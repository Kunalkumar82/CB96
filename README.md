This is a "Tours and Travel" website. The main purpose of “Tours and travels ” is to provide a convenient way for a customer to book hotels, flight, train and bus for the tour purposes. The objective of my project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a hotel agency . In this project, we will make an easier task of searching places and for booking hotels near by users visiting place. In this present website a customer has to approach various visiting places to find details of places and to book hotels. This often requires a lot of time and effort. It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly. The project “Tours and Travels website” is developed to replace the currently existing system, which help in keeping record of customer details of destination as well as payment received. Tourism marketers are faced with a complex environment resulting from unprecedented growth in the tourism industry over the last fifty years. As the phenomenon of tourism has grown, so have the interests of destinations in attracting their share of visitor. Destination choices available to consumers have abundant .
